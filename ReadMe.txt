1. Please refer to "OPMS_QQGE_main.m" for the main code.

2. Notes on using some deblocking models:
- SSRQC: Official code, located in the "SSRQC" folder.  
- DnCNN: Models retrained using the official MATLAB version code, located in the "DnCNN" folder.  
- DRUNet and SwinIR: Models fine-tuned on the official pre-trained parameters, located in the "drunet.zip" and "swinir.zip" archives. Images of different QFs utilize their respective trained deblocking models.
